In this project, I created a ready-to-use product, customer, category and statistics control panel for a store using C# and Sql with Entity Framework, an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework developed by Microsoft.

Turkish: Bu projede Microsoft tarafından geliştirilen ve üzerinde çalışan nesne ilişkisel haritalama (ORM) çerçevesi olan Entity Framework ile C# ve Sql kullanarak bir mağaza için kullanıma hazır ürün, müşteri, kategori ve istatistik kontrol paneli oluşturdum.
